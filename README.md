# Job Portal Project Using Python 

We have developed a fully functional web application using python as backend with SQL Server database and HTML and bootstrap for frontend.
We have created several views for all functions in views.py.
Testing are done and all the test cases for user master, candidate and company models are added tests.py file.

## Modules and basic functions:
	Employee – View the Job posts and can apply for the jobs.
	Employer – Post Jobs and view them.
	Admin   - Delete and update users.
	
## Steps to be followed to run the application :

- Before running the application make sure that you installed all the requirements given in requirement.txt <br />
- Go to settings.py and change the database connection details to your server.<br />
	```
	 DATABASES = {
    	  'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'mssql',
          'NAME': 'Database Name',
          'USER': 'User Name',
          'PASSWORD': 'Password',    
          'HOST': 'Server Name',
          'PORT': '',

          'OPTIONS': {
            'driver': 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server',
                     },
    	            },
	           }
	```
- For running the application: <br />
	```
	python manage.py runserver
	```
## Commands for Database Migrations if any changes needed(Optional):

```
python manage.py makemigrations <app-name>
python manage.py migrate
```
